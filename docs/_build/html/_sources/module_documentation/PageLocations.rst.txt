Page Locations
==============

This class is an intermediate between the :class:`Element <centaurminer.Element>` class and the :class:`MiningEngine <centaurminer.MiningEngine>` class. It holds all of the :class:`Elements <centaurminer.Element>` you want to mine data from, so that the :class:`MiningEngine <centaurminer.MiningEngine>` knows where to locate everything.

It does not contain any functions, just static variables (defined outside of an :code:`__init__` function) containing :class:`Elements <centaurminer.Element>`.
