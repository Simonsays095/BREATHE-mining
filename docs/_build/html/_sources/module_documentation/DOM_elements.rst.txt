DOM Elements
============

There are two main classes for locating an element on the DOM of your site, described below.

.. autoclass:: DOM_elements.Element
   :members:

.. autoclass:: DOM_elements.MetaData
   :members:

There is an additional class, used when you want to indicate that there's heavy post-processing required in the :class:`centaurminer.MiningEngine` subclass.

.. autoclass:: DOM_elements.Complex
   :members:
